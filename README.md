# Number Guessing Game

## About
The game is simple. The computer will think of a number between 1 and 100. You will try to guess the number. The computer will tell you if your guess is too high or too low. You will keep guessing until you get the number right.

## Test Cases From FreeCodeCamp
- Create a `number_guessing_game` folder in the `project` folder for your program
- Create `number_guess.sh` in your `number_guessing_game` folder and give it executable permissions
- Your script should have a shebang at the top of the file that uses `#!/bin/bash`
- Turn the `number_guessing_game` folder into a git repository
- Your git repository should have at least five commits
- Your script should randomly generate a number that users have to guess
- When you run your script, you should prompt the user for a username with `Enter your username:`, and take a username as input. Your database should allow usernames of at least 22 characters
- If that username has been used before, it should print `Welcome back, <username>! You have played <games_played> games, and your best game took <best_game> guesses.`, with `<username>` being a users name from the database, `<games_played>` being the total number of games that user has played, and `<best_game>` being the fewest number of guesses it took that user to win the game
- If the username has not been used before, you should print `Welcome, <username>! It looks like this is your first time here.`
- The next line printed should be `Guess the secret number between 1 and 1000:` and input from the user should be read
- Until they guess the secret number, it should print `It's lower than that, guess again:` if the previous input was higher than the secret number, and `It's higher than that, guess again:` if the previous input was lower than the secret number. Asking for input each time until they input the secret number.
- If anything other than an integer is input as a guess, it should print `That is not an integer, guess again:`
- When the secret number is guessed, your script should print `You guessed it in <number_of_guesses> tries. The secret number was <secret_number>. Nice job!`
- The message for the first commit should be `Initial commit`
- The rest of the commit messages should start with `fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, or `test:`
- You should finish your project while on the `main` branch, your working tree should be clean, and you should not have any uncommitted changes
